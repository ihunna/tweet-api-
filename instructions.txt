===== FILES =====

      (checking accounts for new posts and commenting if new posts are found)
      It can also do login and scraping of accounts,

      To login: type "python commenter.py loginusers", it'll login all users and store
      their cookies for use, so, you can relogin when you want or don't login and use old cookies.

      To scrape users: type "python commenter.py scrapeaccounts", it'll ask for a target account,
      only the account's username should given, it'll ask for the number of accounts to scrape (min 20),
      after this, it'll go to target account and scrape users of the specified quantity and store them in accounts/accounts.json.
